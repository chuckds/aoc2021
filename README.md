# Advent of Code 2021

https://adventofcode.com/2021/

First go at this, lets see what happens

Current pattern to run is:
```
src/d1.py input/d1
src/d2.py input/d2
```

Run tests with:
```
./Taskfile check
```
This runs mypy and pytest. Also set up your repo with the precommit check or
collect code coverage
```
./Taskfile initrepo
./Taskfile coverage
```
